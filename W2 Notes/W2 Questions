What is the difference between class (.) and ID selectors (#)?
   ID used to id a specific element. 
      e.g. specific large paragraph needs to be blue
   class used to id a group of elements with similarities.
      e.g. anyone that uses this class will gain the attribute shadow-box
   pseudo-class is attached to classes that are used for a specific purpose. 
      e.g. tr:hover {color: gray; } every time a cursor hovers over the table row, the row will change color, no matter what is in it.

Is it important what letters are capitalized?
   when creating variables or objects that will be referred to.
